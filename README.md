# My Cypress Automation

This project uses Cypress to automate the testing of an app that looks like a social network for heroes, where you can give likes, money, and create new heroes based on your login. Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows developers to write tests and run them in a real browser.
